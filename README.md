## AI Models Used & How They Work

### BAAI/bge-base-en-v1.5 — Embedding Model

**What it does:** Converts text into numerical vectors (embeddings) that represent the semantic meaning of the text. This enables semantic search — where similar meanings have similar embeddings, not just matching keywords.
**Technical Specs:**

* 110 million parameters (model size)
* Outputs a 768-dimensional vector for each text input
* Input limit \~512 tokens (about 400 words) per chunk
* Speed: \~0.5–2 seconds per text chunk for embedding generation

**How it works (example):** When given two similar sentences, their embeddings will be numerically close to each other. For example:

```python
# Input 1:
"The contract terminates on December 31st"

# Embedding output (768-dim vector, sample):
[0.23, -0.45, 0.67, 0.12, -0.89, ... ]

# Input 2 (similar meaning):
"Agreement ends on Dec 31"

# Embedding output:
[0.25, -0.43, 0.69, 0.14, -0.87, ... ]
# The vectors are very similar, indicating the sentences have similar meaning.
```

### Meta-Llama-3.1-70B-Instruct-Turbo — Main Chat Model

**What it does:** Acts as the primary large language model that reads the legal document context and the user’s question, and generates a comprehensive answer with legal reasoning. It is fine-tuned for instruction following and legal analysis, so it explains in plain English and cites relevant parts of the document.
**Technical Specs:**

* 70 billion parameters (extremely large model)
* Context window: up to 128,000 tokens (\~100,000 words), allowing it to take in very long documents or multiple documents at once
* Speed: \~5–15 seconds for generating a complex legal analysis (using high-performance computing resources)
* Specialty: Designed for following instructions and performing legal reasoning tasks

**How it works:**

```text
Input: [Legal document context] + [User's legal question]

Processing: The model analyzes the context for relevant clauses, evaluates legal implications, checks for risks and exceptions, and formulates an answer.

Output: A detailed answer addressing the question, often with bullet points or numbered lists, and references to specific document sections or external legal knowledge if applicable.
```

### DeepSeek-R1 — Reasoning Model

**What it does:** A specialized reasoning model for performing complex multi-step legal reasoning. It can handle tasks like contract risk assessment or compliance analysis by breaking them down into intermediate steps (a chain-of-thought approach) and ensuring that the final answer considers all relevant factors.
**Technical Specs:**

* Specialty: Chain-of-thought reasoning for legal problems
* Use Case: Activated for particularly complex queries that need step-by-step deduction (e.g., analyzing how multiple clauses interact)
* Speed: \~10–20 seconds for a detailed analysis (slower due to performing multi-step reasoning)

*(Under the hood, the system might use DeepSeek-R1 to produce an outline or reasoning chain, which is then fed into the main chat model for a polished answer.)*

## Complete System Flow: Example Use Case

Let's walk through a real example of how the system would analyze an **Employment Contract**:

**Step 1: User Uploads a Document**
*User action:* The user uploads **"Employment\_Agreement.pdf"**, selecting document type "Employment" and jurisdiction "California".
*File details:* \~2.3 MB PDF, 15 pages.

**Step 2: File Processing**
The system reads the file and extracts text and basic metadata:

```python
# File parser extracts text and finds basic legal elements
extracted_text = "EMPLOYMENT AGREEMENT\n\nThis Employment Agreement..."  # full text of the PDF
pages_found = 15  # number of pages in document

legal_elements_found = [
    {"type": "contract_clause", "text": "WHEREAS, Employee agrees..."},
    {"type": "date", "text": "January 1, 2024"},
    # ...more identified elements like names, dates, clause titles, etc.
]
```

**Step 3: Text Chunking**
The full document text is split into smaller, manageable chunks (e.g., by sections or page limits) for analysis and embedding. For example:

```python
chunks = [
    {
        "section_title": "EMPLOYMENT AGREEMENT (Introduction)",
        "text": "EMPLOYMENT AGREEMENT\n\nThis Employment Agreement is made on ...",
        "chunk_id": 1
    },
    {
        "section_title": "DUTIES AND RESPONSIBILITIES",
        "text": "DUTIES AND RESPONSIBILITIES\n\nEmployee shall perform ...",
        "chunk_id": 2
    },
    {
        "section_title": "COMPENSATION",
        "text": "COMPENSATION\n\nEmployee shall receive ...",
        "chunk_id": 3
    },
    # ... (continues for all sections/clauses, resulting in ~50 chunks for 15 pages)
]
total_chunks = len(chunks)  # e.g., 50
```

**Step 4: Generating Embeddings**
Each chunk of text is converted into a 768-dimensional vector using the embedding model. This allows semantic search and similarity comparison later.

```python
chunk_embeddings = []
for chunk in chunks:
    vector = embedding_model.encode(chunk["text"])  # returns a 768-dim embedding
    chunk_embeddings.append({"chunk_id": chunk["chunk_id"], "vector": vector})

# Example:
chunk_embeddings[0]["vector"]  # [0.23, -0.45, 0.67, ...] 768 numbers
processing_time = "2 minutes 15 seconds"  # total time to embed all chunks
```

**Step 5: Storing in Database**
The extracted data and embeddings are stored in a PostgreSQL database (with the pgvector extension for embeddings) for quick retrieval:

```sql
-- A record for the document
INSERT INTO legal_documents (
    doc_id, filename, doc_type, jurisdiction, practice_area, full_text, metadata
) VALUES (
    15, 'Employment_Agreement.pdf', 'employment', 'California', 'employment',
    '[FULL TEXT HERE]', 
    '{"pages": 15, "title": "Employment Agreement", ...}'
);

-- Records for each chunk (embedding is stored in a vector column)
INSERT INTO legal_chunks (chunk_id, doc_id, chunk_text, embedding)
VALUES 
    (1, 15, 'EMPLOYMENT AGREEMENT...\nThis Employment Agreement...', '[0.27, -0.48, 0.69, ...]'),
    (2, 15, 'DUTIES AND RESPONSIBILITIES...\nEmployee shall...', '[0.31, -0.52, 0.71, ...]'),
    ...;
```

**Step 6: User Asks a Question**
The user poses a question about the document. For example: **"What happens if I quit without giving notice?"**

**Step 7: Semantic Search for Relevant Context**
The question is converted into an embedding vector, and a similarity search is performed in the database to find the most relevant chunks of the document that might contain the answer:

```python
question = "What happens if I quit without giving notice?"
q_vector = embedding_model.encode(question)

# Find top matching chunks using vector similarity
relevant_chunks = search_embeddings(q_vector, top_n=3)
```

Suppose the search returns two highly relevant chunks from the Employment Agreement: one from the *Termination* section, and another from *Termination Penalties* clause. These will be fed into the AI model as context.

**Step 8: AI Generates an Answer**
The system constructs a prompt for the large language model that includes the relevant document sections and the user's question. It then invokes the **Meta-Llama-3.1-70B** model (possibly with help from the **DeepSeek-R1** reasoning model for complex analysis). The AI reads the context and question, and produces a detailed answer with explanations.

*Example AI Answer:*

> **Based on the employment agreement, if you quit without giving the required 30 days written notice:**
> **Direct Answer:** You would be in breach of your contract and subject to the penalties outlined in the agreement.
>
> **Legal Analysis:**
>
> 1. **Notice Requirement:** The contract requires a 30-day written notice before resignation. Quitting without this notice violates that clause.
> 2. **Breach of Contract:** Leaving early is considered a material breach of the agreement, which means you wouldn't be honoring the terms you agreed to.
> 3. **Penalties:** According to the *Termination Penalties* section, you may forfeit certain benefits (like unused vacation payout) and could be held liable for damages or costs incurred by the company due to your abrupt departure.
>
> **Key Legal Concepts:**
>
> * *At-will Employment vs Contractual Obligation:* Even if employment is generally at-will, a contract can impose notice requirements.
> * *Material Breach:* Failing to give notice is a significant breach of the contract terms.
> * *Liquidated Damages:* Some contracts include a clause that predetermines the penalty (e.g., forfeiting bonuses or paying a fee) if notice isn't given.
>
> **Potential Risks:**
>
> * You might lose any severance or bonus that was contingent on fulfilling the notice period.
> * The company could seek reimbursement for costs like hiring a temp or recruiter due to your sudden departure.
> * It may affect references or future job verification, since leaving without notice can be seen as unprofessional.
>
> **Recommendations:**
> If possible, try to negotiate a shorter notice period with your employer. Otherwise, be prepared for the penalties outlined above and consider consulting an employment attorney if you believe the requirement is unreasonable.

**Step 9: Formatting the Response**
Finally, the system packages the answer and relevant details into a structured format (e.g., JSON) to return via the API or to display in the UI. This includes the answer, confidence score, and sources for transparency:

```python
final_response = {
    "query": "What happens if I quit without giving notice?",
    "answer": [AI model's answer text],
    "confidence_score": 0.89,
    "sources": [
        {
            "document": "Employment_Agreement.pdf",
            "section": "Termination",
            "content_snippet": "Employee may terminate this agreement with 30 days written notice...",
            "relevance_score": 0.95
        },
        {
            "document": "Employment_Agreement.pdf",
            "section": "Termination Penalties",
            "content_snippet": "If Employee terminates without notice, Employee shall forfeit...",
            "relevance_score": 0.90
        }
    ],
    "analysis_metadata": {
        "document_type": "Employment Contract",
        "jurisdiction": "California",
        "total_documents_analyzed": 1,
        "total_chunks_analyzed": 50,
        "processing_time": "12 seconds"
    }
}
```

*(In a real application, this JSON would be returned by the API or used to display the answer and sources in the user interface.)*

## Future Enhancements & Scalability

Planned improvements for the system include:

* **Multi-Language Support:** Allow analysis of documents in other languages (Spanish, French, etc.) by incorporating multilingual models.
* **Document Comparison:** Enable side-by-side comparison of multiple contracts (e.g., compare an old contract to a new one to see what changed).
* **Legal Precedent Integration:** Connect to a legal database or case law repository to provide context or precedent relevant to the document (e.g., cite relevant court rulings for a contract clause).
* **Industry-Specific Tuning:** Develop specialized models or rules for specific domains like healthcare, finance, real estate, where contracts might have unique clauses.
* **Real-Time Collaboration:** Allow multiple users (e.g., a team of lawyers) to upload and comment on documents in a shared workspace with AI analysis, enabling collaborative review.
